# Python-Basics
the basics of python courses by Mosh
1. there are multiple variations of python based in other languages
  - CPython in C
  - Jython in java
  - IronPython in C#
  - Pypy in a subset of python
  - you can execute their respective code in these formats
2. How python code is executed:
  - C code needs to go through a compiler and this compiler is different for both mac and pc because it needs to compile into different machine languages
  - java compiler doesn't compile java into machine code it compiles into java bytecode, which then goes through java virtual machine and at run time converts the instruction into machine code
    - this works for windows, mac etc
  - python -> CPython compiler -> Python ByteCode -> Python virtual machine
  -> machine code
  - if you're using Jython, it compiles to java bytecode!
